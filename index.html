            Over the past few decades, R&B music has evolved in many stages.  From the soulful sounds of Motown, to the "Philly Sound" introduced by Gamble & Huff and also the modern sound refined by Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.  This article is an examination of 3 solid decades that produced great soulful music and some of the key artists from each decade I consider responsible for delivering beautiful musical that has stood the test of time.

                    One of the greatest bands of this decade began as a brain-child of the late Maurice White.  The band we now know as Earth, Wind & Fire featured of mostly musicians who played an instrument in the band.  The concept of this band was to explore all of the "elements" of music.  Maurice accomplished this concept by recruiting guitarists (such as his own brother Verdine White on the bass guitar), keyboardists, drummers and the band even had it's own horn section called, "The Phenix Horns"

                    EWF is one of the all-time greatest bands because they not only focused on the vocals, they also focused on the instruments.  Their catalog of music continues to be used to this day by other artists that cover songs or in a sample of songs produced in modern times.

                <h3>1980's</h3>
                <p>
                    When thinking of the 1980's music scene, many may be quick to acknowledge Michael Jackson.  Michael was a great performer, but there was one artist who did stood out due to their focus and love of music.  This artist is simply known by his mononym, Prince.  Prince played multiple instruments on each of his released albums and has a distinction of being one of the very few artists to have produced his own debut album titled, "For You".  It was in this decade that Prince solidified himself as a commercially successful artist.  The album "Purple Rain", that accompanied the movie of the same name, was one of the most successful albums of this decade.

                    What makes Prince extraordinary is his main focus was MUSIC!  Music was his passion.  In the 1990's, he waged a war with Warner Bros. for ownership of his music.  Many people erroneously believe he was doing this for financial reasons.  Prince simply wanted to control his own creation so the record company will not ruin his legacy.  Money was not the motivation; just the passion.  His guitar solos during live performances are unlike anything anyone has ever experienced.  The one thing that was unique to a Prince concert it was they were never the same.

                <h3>1990's</h3>
                <p>
                    The final decade of this century saw the emergence of "Gangsta Rap".  However, there was one band that continued to release music successfully during this time.  That group is known as Tony! Toni! Toné!  This band started as a trio featuring brothers Raphael Wiggins (now Saadiq) and Dwayne Wiggins along with their cousin, Tim Riley.  This band started recording professionally in the late 1980's with successful.  Their best work was known from albums release in the 1990's.  The now classic song, "Anniversary" from the 'Sons of Soul' album has proven to be a timeless piece considering it is still played by couples to this day.  This band was one of the very few R&B acts of this decade to play their own instruments during recording sessions and live on stage.  Lead vocals were normally provided by Raphael and/or Dwayne on each composition.  The late 1990's saw the departure of Raphael as a solo artist, songwriter and producer for other artists.

                    Tony! Toni Toné!, in my opinion, is an underrated band from this era.  This band never had a bad album and they had the distinction of being a band who produced an album that was better than it's previous album.  Many fans long for the day Raphael creates and performs music with the band again.
